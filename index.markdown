In recent years, tourism in Spain has surged bringing economic benefits, but also raising critical questions about housing, regulation, and urban life. Cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Palma de Mallorca have seen an explosion of short-term tourist rentals, especially through platforms like Airbnb. But **how many of these apartments are actually legal**? And **what does this mean for the people who live there**?

In this project, we combine official government records on registered tourist accommodations with Airbnb listing data to uncover the gap between regulation and reality. We also explore how this growth may be influencing housing prices, and whether some Airbnb hosts operate at a scale that resembles a commercial business, rather than casual home-sharing.

Through maps, charts, and analysis, we aim to shed light on how tourism and digital platforms are reshaping urban housing and to ask: **Who are cities really for?**

# How big is the problem?

# Have the rental prices been affected?

# Can we call this a bussiness?
